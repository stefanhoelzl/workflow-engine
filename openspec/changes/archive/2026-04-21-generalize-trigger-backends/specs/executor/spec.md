## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Executor is called only from fire closures

The `Executor.invoke(tenant, workflow, descriptor, input, bundleSource)` method SHALL be called exclusively from the `fire` closures constructed by `WorkflowRegistry.buildFire`. No `TriggerSource` implementation SHALL import or call the executor directly.

This rule makes the backend plugin contract cleanly decoupled: backends see only `TriggerEntry.fire(input)`, a callback, with no knowledge of tenants, workflows, bundle sources, or the executor itself. Identity is captured inside the closure at construction time.

#### Scenario: No backend imports executor

- **GIVEN** the set of `packages/runtime/src/triggers/*.ts` files
- **WHEN** their import graph is inspected
- **THEN** no file SHALL import from `packages/runtime/src/executor/`

#### Scenario: Executor invocation observable via fire

- **GIVEN** a fire closure built by `buildFire`
- **WHEN** the closure is invoked with valid input
- **THEN** the closure SHALL call `executor.invoke(tenant, workflow, descriptor, validatedInput, bundleSource)` exactly once
- **AND** the closure's resolution SHALL equal the executor's returned `InvokeResult`

### Requirement: Executor return shape is kind-agnostic

The `Executor.invoke(…)` method SHALL resolve to a discriminated `InvokeResult<unknown>`:

```
type InvokeResult<T> =
  | { ok: true; output: T }
  | { ok: false; error: { message: string; stack?: string } };
```

The shape SHALL be identical for every trigger kind (HTTP, cron, future kinds). Protocol-specific response shaping (HTTP status/body/headers) SHALL be performed by the calling backend after receiving the `InvokeResult`, NOT by the executor.

`InvokeResult` SHALL NOT embed HTTP-specific fields (`status`, `body`, `headers`). Those are derived by the HTTP `TriggerSource` from the `output` field when `ok: true`, or from a standard `500 internal_error` shape when `ok: false`.

#### Scenario: Executor returns generic InvokeResult

- **GIVEN** a handler that returns `{status: 202, body: {ok: true}}`
- **WHEN** the executor invokes the trigger
- **THEN** `InvokeResult` SHALL be `{ok: true, output: {status: 202, body: {ok: true}}}`
- **AND** the HTTP response shaping (serializing `output` to an HTTP response) SHALL be the HTTP source's responsibility, not the executor's

#### Scenario: Executor reports handler error uniformly

- **GIVEN** a handler that throws `new Error("boom")`
- **WHEN** the executor invokes the trigger
- **THEN** `InvokeResult` SHALL be `{ok: false, error: {message: "boom", stack: <stack>}}`
- **AND** the HTTP source SHALL map this to a 500 response with `{error: "internal_error"}` in its body
- **AND** the cron source SHALL log the failure (no protocol response) and arm the next tick
